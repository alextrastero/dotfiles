# My config

## Install
- Change vim to .vim
- Start vim and PluginInstall should work

### Notes
- Uses [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
- Plugin list are inside vim/.plugins.vim
- Custom mappings are inside vim/.mappings.vim
- I use [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) for iTerm and [Tomorrow](https://github.com/chriskempson/vim-tomorrow-theme) for MacVim

#### Nice to have
