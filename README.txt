My config

Install
- Change vim to .vim
- Start vim and PluginInstall should work

Notes
- Uses [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
- Plugin list are inside vim/.plugins.vim
- Custom mappings are inside vim/.mappings.vim
- I use https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized for iTerm and https://github.com/chriskempson/vim-tomorrow-theme for MacVim
- Add source ~/dev/dotfiles/.zshrc in ~/.zshrc
- Add source ~/dev/dotfiles/.vimrc in ~/.vimrc

Nice to have
