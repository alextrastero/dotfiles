description: Grill the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea. Use when the user wants to stress-test their thinking, or uses any 'grill' trigger phrases.

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round, then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Ask every round with the AskUserQuestion tool, never as prose:
- One question per decision, 2-4 options each.
- Put your recommended option first and append " (Recommended)" to its label. Omit the marker only when it's a fact only the user knows.
- Max 4 questions per call. If the frontier is larger, ask the 4 most load-bearing first and the rest in the next call.
- Put needed context (findings, trade-offs) in a short prose message before the call, and keep question text self-contained so the user never scrolls back.
- Before each call, restate the user's previous answers in one line each, including any free-text "Other" answers that asked something instead of choosing.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
